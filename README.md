# Segregator
Deployed : [Website](https://segregator-fa038.web.app/)

## Introduction
Segregating waste eases our waste disposal, helps in recycling and is good for the environment. Use this tool to segregate waste!

## Technologies:

- [ ] ReactJS (with React Router) as the Javascript library
- [ ] TailwindCSS as the styling library
- [ ] Firebase and Firestore as the backend
- [ ] Machine Learning model to differentiate between various types of wastes.

I only set up Google Auth, as we need to signin with our institute ids only.
